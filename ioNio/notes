- File(File parent, String child)
- ObjectInput/OutputStream - writeObject()/readObject (to/from file)
- available() method only tells you the number of bytes before we block another thread
- Console c = new Console();  // DOES NOT COMPILE - only one instance, all constructors private
- Console console = System.console();
- CREATE_NEW 	Create a new file only if it does not exist, fail otherwise
- Files.exists() - no error, just returns false if file doesn't exist
- Path instances are immutable
- isSameFile - exception if either path doesn't exist OR true in case path are equal(in terms of String.equals())
- createDirectories() creates dir or does nothing if exists already + IO exception if wrong path
- files may not need to have extensions
- To delete a directory, it must be empty (delete(Paht)/deleteIfExists(Path))
- isDirectory(Path), isSymbolicLink(Path), isRegularFile(Path) (they return false if path doesn't exist)
- it is possible for isRegularFile() to return true for a symbolic link, as long as the link resolves to a regular file
- isHidden()(only one that throws IOException), isReadable(), isWritable(), and isExecutable()
- getLastModifiedTime()
- NIO.2 Streams API methods use depth‚Äêfirst searching with a depth limit(which can be changed - int value)
