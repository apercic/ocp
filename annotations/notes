-Creating a custom annotation:
  public(it can also be default package-private) @interface Exercise {
    public abstract int hoursPerDay();      //required
    int start() default 6;  //not required
    
    
    //constant variables - cant be included when we use the annotation
    public static final int MAX_VOLTAGE = 18;
  }
  
Using it:
  @Exercise(hoursPerDay=3) public class Cheetah {}
 
- () when using annotations are optional when no value is passed
- For an element to be optional, rather than required, it must include a default value
- order of values passed doesn't matter

values: 
Integer height(); - wrapper classes are not supported
String[][] generalInfo(); - String[] is supported, String[][] isn't
Enums and annotations are supported
Wrappers, String[][] and custom classes aren't supported

- public abstract is default
- implicitly public, can't change to protected/private OR be final (abstract methods can't be final)
