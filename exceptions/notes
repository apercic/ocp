EXCEPTIONS: 
- In Java, all exceptions that inherit Exception but not RuntimeException are considered checked exceptions(checked need to be handled)
- unchecked exceptions include any class that inherits RuntimeException or Error. An Error is fatal, and it is considered a poor practice to catch it.
- FileNotFoundException and NotSerializableException both inherit from IOException (checked exceptions)
-try‐with‐resources statements require resources that implement the AutoCloseable interface
- checked must be caught / unchecked (Errors and RuntimeExeceptions not)
- Errors are fatal - poor practice to catch thme
